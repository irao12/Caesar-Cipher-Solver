* Caesar Cipher Solver

Solves caesar ciphers by calculating the letter frequencies of the English language
using a copy of Pride and Prejudice provided by Project Gutenberg and finding the minimal
distance between the frequencies of the language and the frequencies of letters that occur
in the encrypted text.

* How to run
1. Install make
2. While in the directory of the project, enter make into the terminal
3. Run by entering ./main

* Note
- If text provided to decrypt is too short, the result may be innacurate.

* Specific instructions

The ~solve~ function should:
1. For each of the 26 rotations of encrypted string:
   1. Make a 26 space vector with the frequencies of all the letters
      based on *encrypted_string*. Note that entries will be 0 for
      letters that don't appear in the input string.
    2. Calculate the distance between this vector and the vector of
       letter frequencies for English.
The rotation with the smallest distance should be the solution.
